--StrataScratch - ID 2145 - Date of Highest User Activity (Medium) - Postgres
--Tiktok want to find out what were the top two most active user days during an advertising campaign they ran in the first week of August 2022 (between the 1st to the 7th).

--Identify the two days with the highest user activity during the advertising campaign.
--They've also specified that user activity must be measured in terms of unique users.
--Output the day, date, and number of users.

--Used rank function to rank days by unique visitor count, used to_char function to extract the weekday name from the date_visited column

select 
        rank() over (order by count(distinct user_id) desc) as Ranking,
        count(distinct user_id) as uni_vis, 
        to_char(date_visited, 'Day'),
        date_visited 
from user_streaks
where date_visited between '2022-08-01' and '2022-08-07'
group by date_visited
limit 2;

--DataLemur - Patient Support Analysis (Part 1) [UnitedHealth SQL Interview Question] (Easy) - Postgres
--UnitedHealth has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs – whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.
--Write a query to find how many UHG members made 3 or more calls. case_id column uniquely identifies each call made.

--Created a CTE to do a count of calls (case_id) grouped by policy holder.  Only pulled policy holders who made three or more calls.  Then did a count of the 
--results from the CTE to find the requested # of customers who made 3 or more calls.

WITH three_calls AS (
SELECT
    policy_holder_id,
    COUNT(case_id)
FROM callers
GROUP BY policy_holder_id
HAVING COUNT(case_id) >= 3)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM three_calls AS member_count;

--DataLemur - Patient Support Analysis (Part 2) [UnitedHealth SQL Interview Question] (Easy) - Postgres
--Calls to the Advocate4Me call centre are categorised, but sometimes they can't fit neatly into a category. These uncategorised calls are labelled “n/a”, or are just empty (when a support agent enters nothing into the category field).

--Write a query to find the percentage of calls that cannot be categorised. Round your answer to 1 decimal place.
--Used the filter clause to do a count of calls categorized as null or 'n/a'

select 
    round((100.0 *
    count(case_id) filter (where call_category is null or call_category = 'n/a')
    /count(case_id)),1) as uncat_per
from callers

--StrataScratch - ID 10159 - Ranking Most Active Guests (Medium) - MySQL
--Rank guests based on the number of messages they've exchanged with the hosts. 
--Guests with the same number of messages as other guests should have the same rank. Do not skip rankings if the preceding rankings are identical.
--Output the rank, guest id, and number of total messages they've sent. Order by the highest number of total messages first.

--Used dense_rank because the question specified that rankings shouldn't be skipped in case of a tie.

select 
        dense_rank () over (order by sum(n_messages) desc) as ranking,
        id_guest, 
        sum(n_messages) as msg_count
from airbnb_contacts
group by id_guest
order by msg_count desc;
